    <p>Chances are high you encountered Brazil’s national drink, the Caipirinha, if you’ve traveled to the South American country. 
        Refreshing and easy to make, the cocktail contains fresh lime juice, sugar and cachaça. The latter is a spirit as central to
         Brazilian identity as samba, soccer and carnival. So much so that cachaça is also the country’s national spirit, inextricably 
         tying this drink to its home.<br>
        First made in the 1500s, cachaça is similar to rum, sure, but has a flavor all its own. Most rums are distilled from molasses, 
        a byproduct of sugarcane processing, while cachaça is distilled from the fermented juice of sugar cane. This important difference 
        yields a spirit that is characterized by its funky, grassy flavors. And those singular flavors set the Caipirinha apart from other 
        sweet-and-sour cocktails like the Daiquiri.</p>
